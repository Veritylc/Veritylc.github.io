            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2024, Verity Law Collective was born out of a need for equitable access to legal resources and services. Our founders, driven by a deep sense of justice and fairness, recognized the barriers faced by many individuals when it comes to navigating the legal system. Whether due to financial constraints or lack of knowledge, many people are unable to access the help they need. Verity Law Collective was created to bridge that gap, providing free resources, legal consultations, and support to those who need it most.</p>

    <!-- Why We Do It -->

            <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
            <p>Our mission is built on the belief that justice should not be a privilege, but a right. Every individual, regardless of their income, background, or education, should have the opportunity to access legal representation and resources. Sadly, the reality is different. The legal system can often be intimidating, complex, and inaccessible for those who need it most.</p>
            <p>We do what we do because we believe that a fair legal system is a cornerstone of a just society. We are committed to standing with the underserved, the marginalized, and the voiceless. Whether you’re navigating a tough personal situation, a legal dispute, or facing a crisis, we’re here to provide the support, resources, and guidance you need to understand and assert your rights.</p>
            <p>Our team is made up of passionate individuals who are deeply committed to social justice. We know that the road to justice can be long and difficult, but we are here to walk that path with you. By offering free services, resources, and access to legal professionals, we hope to make legal support accessible to everyone, no matter their circumstances.</p>
