            <h2>Introduction to Consumer Rights</h2>
            <p>Consumer rights protect individuals in their roles as purchasers of goods and services, ensuring fair treatment, accurate information, and a system to address grievances. These rights empower consumers to make informed decisions and seek justice when treated unfairly.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="rights">
            <h2>Basic Consumer Rights</h2>
            <p>These rights were first introduced by former U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1962 and have since been adopted globally:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right to Safety:</strong> Consumers have the right to be protected from hazardous goods and services. This includes ensuring that products meet safety standards and do not pose health risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Be Informed:</strong> Consumers should have access to accurate information to make educated choices. Misleading advertisements, false labels, or concealed facts violate this right.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Choose:</strong> Consumers deserve freedom of choice, free from monopolistic practices. This right ensures a fair marketplace with diverse, quality products.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Be Heard:</strong> Consumers should have a voice in government policies that affect their rights and well-being. This right also extends to addressing complaints and grievances.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Redress:</strong> If a consumer experiences a defective product or unfair treatment, they are entitled to legal action and compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Consumer Education:</strong> Consumers should have access to information and resources to understand their rights and make informed decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to a Healthy Environment:</strong> Consumers have a right to products and services that do not harm the environment, protecting both individual health and public welfare.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="protection">

        <section id="issues">
            <h2>Common Consumer Rights Issues</h2>
            <p>Many consumer rights issues are rooted in deceptive practices or faulty products. Here are some key areas where consumer rights come into play:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>False Advertising and Misleading Information:</strong> Advertising that misrepresents products or services violates consumer rights. This includes exaggerated claims or hidden terms.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Safety:</strong> Manufacturers must ensure their products are safe to use. For example, food and drug products undergo strict quality control and testing before reaching consumers.</li>
                <li><strong>Unfair Contract Terms:</strong> Contracts should be fair and transparent. Hidden fees, unilateral changes, or deceptive clauses violate this right.</li>
                <li><strong>Online Shopping Scams:</strong> With the growth of e-commerce, fraudulent websites, and scams have become a major concern. Consumers are advised to shop only from reputable sites and check for reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>Right to Refunds and Returns:</strong> When goods are defective or unsatisfactory, consumers should have the right to return them, receive replacements, or get refunds.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy and Protection:</strong> Consumersâ€™ personal data, especially in digital transactions, must be safeguarded to protect against identity theft and privacy invasion.</li>
                <li><strong>Price Transparency:</strong> Prices should be clear, including any additional fees or taxes. Misleading or hidden costs are illegal in many jurisdictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Finance and Lending:</strong> Financial services, including loans and credit, must follow ethical standards, including full disclosure of terms, interest rates, and repayment plans.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="laws">
            <h2>Consumer Protection Laws and Policies</h2>
            <p>Different countries have laws to enforce consumer rights. Here are some key regulations in different regions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consumer Rights Act 2015 (UK):</strong> This act provides the right to a refund, repair, or replacement of faulty goods, and safeguards against misleading contracts.</li>
                <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU):</strong> Protects consumer data and privacy, requiring organizations to obtain consent before collecting personal information.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumer Protection Act (Ireland):</strong> Protects consumers in Ireland by prohibiting false advertising, unfair pricing, and deceptive practices.</li>

                <li><strong>Truth in Lending Act (USA):</strong> Requires lenders to disclose loan terms clearly, including interest rates, fees, and payment schedules.</li>
                <li><strong>The Lemon Law:</strong> Present in many countries, this law mandates that consumers can get a replacement or repair if a product (often a vehicle) has significant defects.</li>
            </ul>
