<!-- Overview of Criminal Law -->
<section id="overview">
    <h1>Criminal Law: Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Criminal law is a critical branch of law that governs crimes committed by individuals or groups. It is aimed at protecting public order, safety, and individual rights by defining behaviors deemed harmful or dangerous to society and prescribing penalties for those who violate these laws.</p>
    <p>Criminal law includes statutes, case law, and procedural rules that govern the conduct of criminal trials, investigations, and punishment. It also deals with civil and constitutional rights related to criminal activity, such as the right to a fair trial, protection from unreasonable searches, and the right to remain silent.</p>

<!-- History of Criminal Law -->
<section id="history" class="section">
    <h2>1. History of Criminal Law</h2>
    <p>The roots of modern criminal law can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Over time, criminal law has evolved, with many nations forming their systems based on their societal norms and values. Some major milestones include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ancient Law Codes:</strong> Early criminal codes, such as the <strong>Code of Hammurabi</strong> in Mesopotamia (1754 BC), laid the foundation for the concept of justice and defined specific crimes and their punishments.</li>
        <li><strong>Roman Law:</strong> The Roman legal system influenced modern criminal law, particularly concepts such as <em>actus reus</em> (guilty act) and <em>mens rea</em> (guilty mind).</li>
        <li><strong>Common Law:</strong> Developed in medieval England, Common Law formed the basis for the criminal justice systems in many English-speaking countries, focusing on case law and judicial precedents.</li>
        <li><strong>Modern Criminal Codes:</strong> The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the rise of national criminal codes, such as the <strong>Penal Code</strong> in the U.S. and the <strong>Criminal Code</strong> in Canada, which codified criminal offenses and punishments into written laws.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Section 1: Principles of Criminal Law -->
<section id="principles" class="section">
    <h2>2. Principles of Criminal Law</h2>

    <h3>Core Principles of Criminal Justice</h3>
    <p>Criminal law is governed by several core principles aimed at ensuring justice and fairness. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Presumption of Innocence:</strong> The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. This principle is fundamental to ensuring fairness in the criminal justice system.</li>
        <li><strong>Burden of Proof:</strong> The burden of proving guilt rests on the prosecution. The defendant does not have to prove their innocence.</li>
        <li><strong>Legality:</strong> A person cannot be convicted of an act that was not defined as a crime at the time it was committed (nullum crimen sine lege).</li>
        <li><strong>Non-retroactivity:</strong> Laws cannot be applied retroactively to acts that were not criminal when committed.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Jeopardy:</strong> A person cannot be tried twice for the same offense once acquitted or convicted.</li>
        <li><strong>Proportionality:</strong> The punishment for a crime should be proportional to the severity of the offense.</li>
        <li><strong>Fairness:</strong> All criminal trials must be conducted in a fair and transparent manner to ensure that the rights of the accused are respected.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 2: Classification of Crimes -->
<section id="crime_categories" class="section">
    <h2>3. Classification of Crimes</h2>
    <p>Crimes are categorized based on their severity, impact on society, and the punishment associated with them. Below are the key classifications:</p>
    
    <h3>Felonies</h3>
    <p>Felonies are serious crimes that typically carry a sentence of more than one year of imprisonment or even the death penalty in some jurisdictions. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Murder:</strong> The unlawful killing of another person with intent or extreme recklessness.</li>
        <li><strong>Rape:</strong> Sexual assault without consent.</li>
        <li><strong>Kidnapping:</strong> Taking someone by force or threat.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggravated Assault:</strong> An attack with the intent to cause severe injury or using a weapon.</li>
        <li><strong>Drug Trafficking:</strong> The distribution and sale of illegal drugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Misdemeanors</h3>
    <p>Misdemeanors are less severe crimes that generally result in shorter sentences (less than one year) or alternative penalties such as fines or community service. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Petty Theft:</strong> Stealing property of relatively low value.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple Assault:</strong> Physical attack that does not cause significant injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Intoxication:</strong> Being visibly drunk or under the influence of drugs in a public space.</li>
        <li><strong>Vandalism:</strong> Deliberately damaging or defacing property.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Infractions</h3>
    <p>Infractions are the least serious offenses and are often punished by fines or warnings. They typically do not lead to jail time. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traffic Violations:</strong> Speeding, running a red light, or other minor violations of traffic laws.</li>
        <li><strong>Littering:</strong> Improperly discarding trash in public spaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Jaywalking:</strong> Crossing the street unlawfully outside of a designated crosswalk.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 3: Legal Processes -->
<section id="procedures" class="section">
    <h2>4. Legal Processes in Criminal Law</h2>
    <p>The criminal justice process follows a series of steps, starting with the investigation of a crime and ending with a conviction or acquittal. Below are the stages involved:</p>

    <h3>Investigation</h3>
    <p>The investigation phase is critical to gathering evidence and identifying suspects. It often involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search Warrants:</strong> Law enforcement officers may need a search warrant to enter private property to gather evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Forensic Evidence:</strong> The use of scientific methods to examine physical evidence such as DNA, fingerprints, and ballistic analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Law enforcement may use surveillance technologies, including wiretaps, GPS tracking, and CCTV, to monitor suspects.</li>
        <li><strong>Interrogation:</strong> Police officers may question suspects to gather information, sometimes using techniques like psychological pressure or deception (within legal boundaries).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Arrest</h3>
    <p>If investigators believe they have enough evidence, they may arrest a suspect. The arrest must follow legal procedures to ensure it is valid:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Miranda Rights:</strong> The suspect must be informed of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.</li>
        <li><strong>Probable Cause:</strong> Officers must have reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed a crime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Arraignment</h3>
    <p>The arraignment is the formal reading of the charges to the defendant. It is where the accused pleads guilty, not guilty, or no contest.</p>

    <h3>Pre-Trial Procedures</h3>
    <p>Pre-trial hearings are scheduled to resolve procedural issues and determine whether the case should go to trial. Common pre-trial motions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Motion to Dismiss:</strong> Request to dismiss the case due to insufficient evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Motion to Suppress:</strong> Request to exclude certain evidence from trial because it was obtained unlawfully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Trial</h3>
    <p>If the case proceeds to trial, both the prosecution and the defense present their cases before a judge and jury.</p>

    <h4>Key Stages of Trial</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Opening Statements:</strong> Both sides present an outline of their case and arguments.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation of Evidence:</strong> Both sides present physical evidence and call witnesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Examination:</strong> The opposing side has the opportunity to challenge witnesses and evidence.</li>
        <li><strong>Closing Arguments:</strong> Each side summarizes their case.</li>
        <li><strong>Jury Deliberation:</strong> The jury discusses the case and reaches a verdict.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sentencing</h3>
    <p>If the defendant is convicted, sentencing follows, where a judge determines the appropriate punishment based on factors like the severity of the crime and the defendant's prior history.</p>

    <h3>Appeal</h3>
    <p>If the defendant believes there were legal errors during the trial, they may appeal the conviction to a higher court.</p>

<!-- Section 4: Defenses in Criminal Law -->
<section id="defenses" class="section">
    <h2>5. Defenses in Criminal Law</h2>
    <p>Defendants in criminal cases have the right to raise defenses that can reduce the charges or lead to an acquittal. Common defenses include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-defense:</strong> The defendant argues that they used force to protect themselves from imminent harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Insanity:</strong> The defendant claims they were legally insane at the time of the crime and did not understand the nature of their actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> The defendant provides evidence proving they were elsewhere when the crime occurred.</li>
        <li><strong>Duress:</strong> The defendant claims they committed the crime due to a threat of harm from someone else.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrapment:</strong> The defendant argues that law enforcement induced them to commit the crime.</li>
    </ul>
