<!-- Overview of Criminal Law -->
<section id="overview">
    <h1>Criminal Law: Comprehensive Guide</h1>
    <p>Criminal law is the branch of law that deals with conduct that is harmful or dangerous to society. It defines crimes, regulates the prosecution of alleged offenders, and prescribes punishment for those convicted of committing crimes. Criminal law serves to maintain public order, safeguard individuals, and uphold societal norms.</p>
    <p>Key elements of criminal law include the definition of criminal offenses, procedures for investigation and trial, the rights of the accused, and the types of punishments for those convicted of crimes.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 1: Principles of Criminal Law -->
<section id="principles" class="section">
    <h2>1. Principles of Criminal Law</h2>

    <h3>Core Principles</h3>
    <p>Criminal law is based on key principles that guide its operation and ensure fairness in its application. These principles protect individuals' rights and ensure a just system of justice:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Presumption of Innocence:</strong> The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. This means that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution.</li>
        <li><strong>Burden of Proof:</strong> In a criminal trial, the prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt." This standard is crucial for ensuring that the innocent are not convicted.</li>
        <li><strong>Legality Principle:</strong> There can be no crime without law. A conduct can only be criminalized if it was clearly defined as a crime at the time it was committed.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-retroactivity:</strong> Laws cannot be applied retroactively to acts committed before the law was passed, as this would violate fundamental fairness.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Jeopardy:</strong> A person cannot be tried twice for the same crime once acquitted or convicted in a previous trial.</li>
        <li><strong>Proportionality:</strong> The punishment for a crime must be proportionate to the severity of the crime itself, ensuring fairness in sentencing.</li>
        <li><strong>Mens Rea and Actus Reus:</strong> A crime typically requires both a guilty mind (mens rea) and a guilty act (actus reus). Both must be present for a defendant to be convicted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Categories of Criminal Offenses</h3>
    <p>Criminal offenses are generally classified into three categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Felonies:</strong> These are serious crimes, often punishable by lengthy prison sentences, life imprisonment, or even the death penalty. Examples include murder, rape, and armed robbery.</li>
        <li><strong>Misdemeanors:</strong> Less serious crimes that typically result in shorter jail sentences or fines. Examples include petty theft, simple assault, and public intoxication.</li>
        <li><strong>Infractions:</strong> Minor violations, often punishable by fines or warnings. Traffic violations and littering are examples of infractions.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Section 2: Crime Categories -->
<section id="crime_categories" class="section">
    <h2>2. Categories of Crimes</h2>

    <h3>Felonies</h3>
    <p>Felonies are the most serious category of crimes. They are punishable by death, life imprisonment, or long-term prison sentences. Felonies are typically crimes that cause significant harm or danger to public safety or individuals.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Murder:</strong> The unlawful killing of another person, often with malicious intent. Degrees of murder vary depending on the intent and circumstances (e.g., first-degree murder, manslaughter).</li>
        <li><strong>Rape:</strong> Sexual assault involving non-consensual intercourse or sexual acts.</li>
        <li><strong>Robbery:</strong> The use of force, threats, or intimidation to steal property from another person.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggravated Assault:</strong> An attack with the intent to cause serious bodily harm or with a weapon.</li>
        <li><strong>Drug Trafficking:</strong> The illegal production, distribution, or sale of drugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Misdemeanors</h3>
    <p>Misdemeanors are less severe offenses, typically punished by less than one year of imprisonment or other penalties like fines or community service.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Petty Theft:</strong> Stealing property worth a small amount of money.</li>
        <li><strong>Vandalism:</strong> Willful destruction of property, such as graffiti or breaking windows.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple Assault:</strong> A physical altercation where the offender does not cause significant injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Driving Under the Influence (DUI):</strong> Operating a vehicle while impaired by alcohol or drugs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Infractions</h3>
    <p>Infractions are the least serious offenses, often resulting in fines or warnings rather than arrest or jail time. These offenses generally do not carry a criminal record or long-lasting penalties.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traffic Violations:</strong> Such as speeding, running a red light, or parking illegally.</li>
        <li><strong>Littering:</strong> Disposing of waste in public areas without following proper disposal methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Jaywalking:</strong> Crossing a street illegally or unsafely outside of a designated crosswalk.</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Section 3: Criminal Procedure -->
<section id="procedures" class="section">
    <h2>3. Criminal Procedure</h2>
    <p>The criminal procedure outlines the steps through which criminal cases are processed, from the investigation to the trial and eventual punishment. These procedures are designed to protect the rights of the accused while ensuring justice is served.</p>

    <h3>Investigation</h3>
    <p>The criminal justice process begins with an investigation, where law enforcement officials collect evidence, identify potential suspects, and determine whether a crime has been committed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Search Warrants:</strong> Law enforcement often need search warrants to gather evidence from private property. A judge must approve the warrant, which must specify what is being searched for and why.</li>
        <li><strong>Surveillance:</strong> Investigators may use wiretaps, surveillance cameras, or undercover operations to gather information on suspects.</li>
        <li><strong>Interviews and Interrogations:</strong> Suspects and witnesses may be interviewed to gather information about the crime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Arrest</h3>
    <p>If law enforcement gathers enough evidence, they may arrest the suspect. The arrest must follow legal guidelines to ensure that the individualâ€™s rights are upheld.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Miranda Rights:</strong> Suspects must be informed of their rights, including the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney.</li>
        <li><strong>Arrest Warrants:</strong> In most cases, a warrant must be obtained before an arrest can occur, unless the crime is witnessed by an officer or occurs in their presence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Arraignment</h3>
    <p>The first court appearance after an arrest is the arraignment, where the defendant is formally charged with the offense and given the opportunity to enter a plea.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Plea Options:</strong> The defendant can plead guilty, not guilty, or no contest. A plea bargain may be offered in some cases to avoid trial.</li>
        <li><strong>Bail:</strong> The court may set bail, allowing the defendant to be released until trial, or may hold them in custody if deemed a flight risk or a danger to the community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Pre-trial</h3>
    <p>During the pre-trial phase, both the defense and prosecution exchange evidence, prepare their arguments, and file motions. This phase may also include hearings to resolve any legal issues.</p>

    <h3>Trial</h3>
    <p>If the case goes to trial, both sides present their evidence and arguments to a judge or jury. The prosecution must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Opening Statements:</strong> Both sides outline their arguments and the evidence they will present.</li>
        <li><strong>Witness Testimony:</strong> Both the prosecution and defense can call witnesses to testify in support of their case.</li>
        <li><strong>Closing Arguments:</strong> After the evidence is presented, both sides make final arguments before the judge or jury deliberates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sentencing</h3>
    <p>If the defendant is convicted, the court will impose a sentence. The severity of the sentence depends on factors such as the crime, the defendantâ€™s history, and mitigating circumstances.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Types of Sentences:</strong> Sentences can range from fines, probation, and community service to lengthy prison sentences or capital punishment.</li>
        <li><strong>Aggravating and Mitigating Factors:</strong> Factors such as the defendant's age, mental state, or previous criminal record may influence the sentence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Appeal</h3>
    <p>If the defendant believes the trial was unfair or there was an error in the law, they may file an appeal with a higher court. The appellate court reviews the case for legal errors, not factual disputes.</p>
</section>

<!-- Section 4: Defenses in Criminal Law -->
<section id="defenses" class="section">
    <h2>4. Defenses in Criminal Law</h2>
    <p>Defendants in criminal cases have the right to raise defenses that can lead to a reduction of charges or even complete acquittal. These defenses may argue that the defendant was not responsible for the crime or that their rights were violated during the investigation or trial.</p>
    
    <h3>Common Defenses</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Self-defense:</strong> The defendant argues they used force to protect themselves from imminent harm.</li>
        <li><strong>Insanity:</strong> The defendant claims they were legally insane at the time of the crime and therefore could not understand the nature of their actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Alibi:</strong> The defendant presents evidence proving they were somewhere else when the crime was committed.</li>
        <li><strong>Duress:</strong> The defendant argues they committed the crime under threat of harm from another person.</li>
        <li><strong>Entrapment:</strong> The defendant claims they were coerced by law enforcement to commit the crime.</li>
    </ul>
