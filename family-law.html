        <!-- Section 1: Marriage and Legal Unions -->
        <section id="marriage">
            <h2>1. Marriage and Legal Unions</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition of Marriage:</strong> Marriage is a legally binding contract between two individuals that confers legal rights and responsibilities. It often involves mutual consent, legal recognition by the state, and the intention to create a family, with considerations of property, finances, and parental duties.</p>
            <p><strong>Marriage License and Requirements:</strong> This process typically begins with obtaining a marriage license from a government agency, requiring both parties to be legally eligible (e.g., age restrictions, mental capacity, no existing marriage). Different jurisdictions have varying requirements for witnesses, waiting periods, and officiants.</p>
            <p><strong>Same-Sex Marriage:</strong> This involves two people of the same gender entering into a legally recognized marriage. It includes rights to property, adoption, healthcare, and tax benefits. Laws vary widely across regions and countries.</p>
            <p><strong>Marriage Annulments vs. Divorce:</strong> An annulment legally voids a marriage, as if it never existed, often due to factors like fraud or lack of consent. Divorce, on the other hand, ends a legally recognized marriage.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section 2: Divorce and Legal Separation -->
        <section id="divorce">

            <p><strong>Filing for Divorce:</strong> One spouse files a petition to start the divorce process. The petition may cite grounds such as irreconcilable differences or specific issues like adultery or cruelty.</p>
            <p><strong>Grounds for Divorce:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No-Fault Divorce:</strong> Based on irretrievable breakdown, without placing blame on either party.</li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Legal Separation:</strong> This arrangement allows a married couple to live separately while remaining legally married, often for religious or personal reasons. It includes decisions on support, custody, and asset division.</p>
            <p><strong>Fault vs. No-Fault Divorce:</strong> Many areas use no-fault divorce, but some still allow fault-based grounds, potentially affecting alimony, custody, and asset division.</p>
