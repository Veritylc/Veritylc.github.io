            <h2 class="section-title">Marriage and Legal Unions</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition of Marriage:</strong> Marriage is a legally binding contract between two individuals that confers legal rights and responsibilities. It often involves mutual consent, legal recognition by the state, and the intention to create a family. It typically involves considerations of property, finances, and parental duties.</p>
            <p><strong>Marriage License and Requirements:</strong> The marriage process typically begins with obtaining a marriage license from a government agency, which requires both parties to be legally eligible (e.g., age restrictions, mental capacity, no existing marriage). Different jurisdictions have varying requirements for witnesses, waiting periods, and officiants.</p>
            <p><strong>Same-Sex Marriage:</strong> Same-sex marriage involves two people of the same gender entering into a legally recognized marriage. While some countries and regions have long recognized same-sex marriages, others are still in the process of passing legislation to legalize or recognize these unions. This includes rights to property, adoption, healthcare, and tax benefits.</p>
            <p><strong>Marriage Annulments vs. Divorce:</strong> An annulment is a legal decree that a marriage is void, as if it never existed. Common grounds for annulment include fraud, lack of consent, incest, or bigamy. This is distinct from divorce, which acknowledges that the marriage existed but ends it legally.</p>

        <section class="resource-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Divorce and Legal Separation</h2>
            <p><strong>Filing for Divorce:</strong> To initiate a divorce, one spouse (the petitioner) files a petition or complaint with the court. The other spouse (the respondent) is then served with notice. The petition may cite grounds for divorce, such as irreconcilable differences or specific acts like adultery or cruelty.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No-Fault Divorce:</strong> Neither party is blamed for the breakdown of the marriage, often based on irretrievable breakdown.</li>
                <li><strong>Fault-Based Divorce:</strong> One spouse must prove the other's misconduct (e.g., adultery, cruelty, desertion).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Legal Separation:</strong> Legal separation allows a married couple to live separately but remain legally married. It often involves decisions regarding spousal support, child custody, and asset division. It may be used as a precursor to divorce or as an alternative for religious or personal reasons.</p>
            <p><strong>Fault vs. No-Fault Divorce:</strong> While many places have transitioned to no-fault divorce laws, fault-based divorces may still be available, often resulting in different implications for alimony, custody, or division of assets.</p>

        <section class="resource-section">
            <h2 class="section-title">Property and Asset Division</h2>
            <p><strong>Community Property vs. Equitable Distribution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Community Property:</strong> Assets and debts acquired during the marriage are considered jointly owned and are split equally upon divorce.</li>
                <li><strong>Equitable Distribution:</strong> Assets and debts are divided fairly but not necessarily equally. Factors like the length of the marriage and each spouse’s contributions are considered.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Dividing Assets:</strong> Assets include property, money, investments, and retirement accounts. Divorce may involve evaluating the value of shared property, determining separate property, and handling complex items like real estate, businesses, or intellectual property.</p>
            <p><strong>Division of Debts:</strong> Debts accumulated during marriage may be divided between spouses. How debts are divided depends on whether they are joint or separate.</p>
            <p><strong>Spousal Support (Alimony):</strong> Different types of alimony may include temporary, permanent, and rehabilitative support, each tailored to specific financial situations.</p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Visitation Rights:</strong> If one parent has primary physical custody, the other may have visitation rights, which vary based on the child's needs and parents' schedules.</p>
            <p><strong>Parental Alienation:</strong> When one parent distances the child from the other parent through negative statements or actions, potentially affecting custody decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>Best Interests of the Child:</strong> Courts decide custody based on factors like emotional ties, needs, and each parent’s ability to meet those needs.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Adoption and Guardianship</h2>
            <p><strong>Domestic vs. International Adoption:</strong> Domestic adoption takes place within one’s country, whereas international adoption involves specific regulations like the Hague Convention.</p>
            <p><strong>Open vs. Closed Adoption:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open Adoption:</strong> Allows contact between birth and adoptive parents.</li>
                <li><strong>Closed Adoption:</strong> No contact occurs between birth parents and adoptive families.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Guardianship vs. Adoption:</strong> Guardianship provides temporary or permanent care but does not sever parental rights, unlike adoption.</p>
            <p><strong>Grandparents’ Rights:</strong> Grandparents may seek custody or visitation if biological parents cannot care for the child.</p>
