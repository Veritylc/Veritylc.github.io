    <h2>1. Marriage and Legal Unions</h2>
    
    <h3>Types of Legal Unions</h3>
    <p>
        **Marriage**
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Civil Marriage:</strong> A state-recognized, legally binding union granting both spouses various rights, responsibilities, and protections under the law. Civil marriages are required to follow regulations that vary by jurisdiction, such as residency, age, and consent requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Religious Marriage:</strong> A marriage ceremony performed by a religious authority. In many places, couples must also obtain a civil license to receive legal recognition. Requirements may align with religious doctrines rather than civil laws, which can impact legal validity in specific regions.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        **Alternative Unions**
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Civil Union:</strong> An alternative to marriage often providing similar legal protections for same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Civil unions may lack federal recognition, especially in countries where same-sex marriage is legalized.</li>
            <li><strong>Domestic Partnership:</strong> Generally offers limited rights, such as hospital visitation and certain healthcare benefits, and is usually limited to cohabitating couples. Unlike marriage, it often lacks full legal protections regarding inheritance or tax benefits.</li>
            <li><strong>Common Law Marriage:</strong> Recognized in some regions when a couple lives together for a certain period and presents themselves as married. Common law marriages may grant certain rights but often require legal proceedings to dissolve if separation occurs.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Formation Requirements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age and Consent:</strong> Most regions require individuals to be at least 18 to marry. Some jurisdictions allow younger individuals to marry with parental consent or court approval.</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Capacity:</strong> Both parties must have the mental capacity to understand the nature and significance of marriage.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Consent:</strong> Marriage requires the voluntary consent of both parties, ensuring neither is coerced or defrauded into marriage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Prohibited Relationships:</strong> Close blood relatives, such as siblings or parent-child unions, are typically barred from marriage. In most places, polygamous marriages are illegal, though some cultures or religions permit them under specific conditions.</p>

    <h3>Marriage and Civil Union Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Legal and Financial Rights:</strong> Includes tax deductions, social security benefits, health insurance access, and immigration sponsorship.</li>

        <li><strong>Medical and Health Rights:</strong> Authority in medical decision-making, hospital visitation, and healthcare power of attorney.</li>
        <li><strong>Parental and Family Rights:</strong> Legal presumption of parentage, adoption rights, and prioritized parental custody considerations.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h3>Termination of Marriage or Civil Union</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Divorce (Dissolution):</strong> The formal process for ending a marriage. Includes fault vs. no-fault grounds, residency prerequisites, and equitable property division.</li>
        <li><strong>Annulment:</strong> A legal procedure to void a marriage based on fraud, incapacity, or close kinship, rendering it null as if it never occurred.</li>
        <li><strong>Separation:</strong> Allows couples to live apart legally while maintaining marriage status. Formal agreements dictate custody, support, and asset management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>International Marriage Laws</h3>
    <p><strong>Recognition of Foreign Marriages:</strong> Many countries recognize foreign marriages if they’re legal where performed. Certain marriages, like polygamous or same-sex, may face non-recognition in regions with differing laws.</p>
    <p><strong>International Prenuptial and Postnuptial Agreements:</strong> Legal enforceability varies internationally, with some countries enforcing foreign agreements while others require local validation.</p>

    <h3>Same-Sex Marriage</h3>
    <p><strong>Global Status:</strong> Many countries now recognize same-sex marriage, extending equal rights in adoption, inheritance, and immigration. In regions without marriage rights, alternatives like civil unions provide limited recognition.</p>

    <h3>Legal Documents Associated with Marriage</h3>

        <li><strong>Collaborative Divorce:</strong> Couples and attorneys negotiate to avoid court proceedings.</li>
