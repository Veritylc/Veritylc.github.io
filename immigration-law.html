    <h2 class="blue-header">1. Immigration Law</h2>
    <p>Immigration law governs the legal framework for regulating the entry, residence, and status of individuals within a country's territory. Immigration laws address a wide range of issues, including visas, asylum, permanent residency, citizenship, and the rights of immigrants. These laws also govern the deportation of individuals, the responsibilities of individuals seeking entry, and the protection available to asylum seekers and refugees. Immigration law is a complex area, often involving both national laws and international frameworks, such as human rights laws, international treaties, and regional agreements like the European Union (EU).</p>

    <h3 class="blue-header">2. U.S. Immigration Law</h3>
    <p>The U.S. immigration system is one of the most intricate in the world, governed by both federal and state laws, as well as regulations issued by various agencies like the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The legal framework is dynamic, with continuous debates on issues such as border security, pathways to citizenship, and the status of undocumented immigrants. Below are key components of U.S. immigration law, highlighting the most relevant aspects that shape the policies today.</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">2.1 Visa Categories in the U.S.</h4>
    <p>U.S. immigration law divides visas into two major categories: non-immigrant (temporary) visas and immigrant (permanent) visas. Each category includes specific visa types based on the applicant’s purpose of visit.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-Immigrant Visas:</strong> These visas are issued to individuals who intend to stay in the U.S. for a limited time for specific reasons. These include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tourist Visa (B-1/B-2):</strong> For individuals visiting the U.S. temporarily for business or tourism purposes.</li>
                <li><strong>Student Visa (F-1, M-1):</strong> Issued to international students studying at accredited U.S. institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Exchange Visitor Visa (J-1):</strong> For individuals coming to the U.S. as part of an exchange program, including researchers, professors, and medical trainees.</li>
                <li><strong>Work Visas:</strong> There are several visa categories for foreign nationals coming to work in the U.S., such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>H-1B Visa:</strong> For highly skilled workers in specialized fields like technology, engineering, and medicine.</li>
                        <li><strong>O-1 Visa:</strong> For individuals with extraordinary abilities in fields like arts, sciences, or athletics.</li>
                        <li><strong>L-1 Visa:</strong> For intra-company transferees who are being relocated to a U.S. office from a foreign office.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Immigrant Visas:</strong> These visas are for individuals intending to immigrate permanently to the U.S. These are divided into various categories:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Family-Based Immigration:</strong> U.S. citizens or permanent residents can sponsor close family members, including spouses, children, and siblings, for immigration. There are different preferences based on the relationship to the sponsor (Immediate relatives, F1, F2, F3, F4 categories).</li>
                <li><strong>Employment-Based Immigration:</strong> Individuals who have received a job offer in the U.S. or possess extraordinary skills can apply for permanent residency. These include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>EB-1:</strong> Priority workers such as professors, researchers, executives, and those with extraordinary skills in arts or sciences.</li>
                        <li><strong>EB-2:</strong> For individuals with advanced degrees or exceptional ability in fields such as science, business, or the arts.</li>
                        <li><strong>EB-3:</strong> For skilled workers, professionals with bachelor’s degrees, and other workers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Refugee and Asylum Status:</strong> Refugees are individuals seeking asylum due to fear of persecution in their home countries. Asylum seekers must apply either within one year of arrival or from abroad.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="blue-header">2.2 Green Card and Permanent Residency</h4>
    <p>The Green Card is issued to individuals who are granted lawful permanent resident status. Green Card holders are allowed to live and work in the U.S. indefinitely, but they must maintain their status by residing in the U.S. and not violating the terms of their residency. The process of obtaining a Green Card can be family-sponsored, employment-based, or achieved through asylum or refugee status.</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">2.3 Pathways to U.S. Citizenship</h4>
    <p>Naturalization is the process by which a lawful permanent resident (Green Card holder) becomes a U.S. citizen. Applicants must meet specific criteria, including residing in the U.S. for at least five years (or three years if married to a U.S. citizen), passing an English proficiency test and a civics exam, demonstrating good moral character, and taking the Oath of Allegiance.</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">2.4 Asylum and Refugee Law</h4>
    <p>The U.S. offers protection to individuals who face persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. Individuals can apply for asylum if they are already in the U.S. or refugee status if they are outside the U.S. and are being resettled. There are specific criteria for establishing eligibility, and applicants must demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution.</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">2.5 Deportation and Removal</h4>
    <p>Deportation is the formal removal of a non-citizen from the U.S. due to violations of immigration laws, such as overstaying a visa, committing crimes, or submitting fraudulent documents. Immigration courts handle deportation cases, and individuals can contest the removal by applying for relief such as asylum, cancellation of removal, or adjustment of status.</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">2.6 Immigration Reform</h4>
    <p>U.S. immigration reform remains a highly contentious topic in American politics. Proposals for reform typically include pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, the establishment of more secure borders, the revision of visa systems to meet labor demands, and reforms to the asylum and refugee systems.</p>

    <h3 class="blue-header">3. European Immigration Law</h3>
    <p>European immigration law operates within the context of both individual country policies and EU-wide agreements. It emphasizes human rights protection, refugee protection, and a collective approach to immigration, asylum, and border management. The EU’s shared framework allows for more coordinated migration policies while maintaining the sovereignty of member states to regulate immigration.</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">3.1 EU Immigration and Visa Policy</h4>
    <p>The European Union has a common immigration policy for managing borders, visas, and asylum seekers. While individual member states maintain control over their immigration laws, they must adhere to EU-wide regulations and frameworks regarding refugees, asylum seekers, and visa requirements.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Schengen Area:</strong> The Schengen Area allows for the free movement of individuals across 27 European countries without internal borders. Countries within this area implement coordinated visa policies, and individuals entering one country can move freely within others.</li>
        <li><strong>EU Blue Card:</strong> The EU Blue Card allows highly skilled non-EU nationals to live and work in EU countries. It is similar to the U.S. H-1B visa and is designed to attract professionals in sectors like technology, engineering, and medicine.</li>
        <li><strong>Asylum and Refugee Protection:</strong> The EU provides robust protections for asylum seekers, especially under the Dublin Regulation, which determines the EU country responsible for processing an asylum claim.</li>
        <li><strong>Family Reunification:</strong> Immigration policies across EU countries allow family members of legal residents to join them in the country. The criteria for family reunification vary by country but typically apply to spouses, children, and sometimes extended family members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="blue-header">3.2 EU Law on Border Security and Immigration Enforcement</h4>
    <p>The EU has developed specific rules for border security and immigration enforcement to protect the external borders of the Schengen Area. This includes cooperation with non-EU countries, shared databases for immigration control, and common standards for border checks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frontex:</strong> The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) is responsible for assisting EU member states with border security and managing external borders.</li>
        <li><strong>Visa Information System (VIS):</strong> This system is used to collect and share data on visa applicants to enhance border control and prevent fraud.</li>
        <li><strong>Common European Asylum System (CEAS):</strong> This system sets out common standards for asylum applications, appeals, and refugee status determination procedures across EU countries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="blue-header">3.3 Asylum Procedures and Refugee Status</h4>
    <p>Asylum seekers in Europe have the right to apply for protection if they fear persecution in their home country. The European Union provides a framework for asylum procedures that ensures fair and efficient processing. The key principles include non-refoulement (not returning refugees to countries where they face harm) and the right to an effective remedy (appeal rights).</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">3.4 Deportation and Expulsion in Europe</h4>
    <p>EU law allows for the deportation of individuals who violate immigration laws or pose a national security risk. Deportation decisions are subject to appeal in most cases, and individuals may be able to seek protection under human rights law if they face risk in their home country.</p>

    <h4 class="blue-header">3.5 Immigration Reform in Europe</h4>
    <p>Immigration reform in Europe focuses on issues such as refugee quotas, integration programs for immigrants, and border security measures. Member states continue to debate how best to balance humanitarian responsibilities with national security concerns, with some advocating for stricter controls and others pushing for more open policies.</p>
